But, one problem though, many people aren't willing to provide over 100 dollar equipment for this five dollar lizard.</p>
  <p> The equipment needed is not commonly provided, and the Green Anole lacks light and needed daily items which can result in death.

  <h1 id="Care"> Care</h1>
  <p>They require a warm, humid environment.
Your anole’s terrarium should be warmer at the top and cooler at the bottom. By day, keep the temperature at the top of the terrarium between 85 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29 to 32 Celsius) and the temperature at the bottom of the terrarium between 75 and 85 F (24 to 29 C). At night, the whole tank should be 65 to 75 F (18 to 24 C).</p>

<h1 id="Food">Food</h1>
<p>How much? How Big? This list got you covered.
<ul>
<li>Feed anoles 2 to 5 crickets daily. Insects should be no more than half as big as the anole’s head.</li>
<li>Dust your anole’s food 2 to 3 times a week with a calcium supplement and once a week with a multivitamin.</li>
<li>Provide a shallow dish of water. (Anoles will drink from this and also lick moisture from their skin and habitat.) Refresh the water daily.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h1 id="Healthy">Signs of a unhealthy Green Anole.</h1>
<p> A Healthy Green Anole should not have any of these symptoms:
<ul>
<li>Avoidance of the basking area; more time spent hiding</li>
<li>Eating or drinking less; weight loss</li>
<li>Swollen joints</li>
<li>Discharge from the eyes, nose or mouth</li>
<li>Runny droppings for more than two days</li>
<li>Shedding problems; discolored skin</li>
</ul>
If they have these symptoms, rush them to the vet.
</p>
<h1 id="Tips">Safety Tips For You And Your Anole.</h1>
<p>1. ALL ANIMALS can potentially carry viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases contagious to humans. 2. Thoroughly wash your hands with
warm, soapy water before and after contact with any pet or its habitat. 3. Adults should assist children with hand washing after contact with a pet or its enclosure. 4. Use caution when handling pets, and remember they may bite or scratch, especially when stressed.</p>
<h1 id="ProsCons">Pros and Cons</h1>
<h2>Pros:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to have multiple Green Anoles and house them in a colony.</li>
<li>Because they are from the US, they are readily available.</li>
<li>Many people have wild Green Anoles in their garden and benefit as they eat pest insects.</li>
<li>Their solid green appearance and active nature makes them a great reptile for display tanks.</li>
<h2>Cons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>This species is very agile and delicate, so they should not be handled regularly.</li>
<li>They require advanced husbandry and need very specific tank conditions to remain healthy.</li>
<li>They like to climb and escape, and so will need a very secure terrarium.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Babies">Baby Green Anoles</h1>
<p>Baby Green Anoles are born just two inches in size. They are considered to be adults once they reach 5 inches in length.

They must be fed five pinhead crickets and flightless fruit flies daily.

Hatchlings can be housed in a 5 to 10-gallon tank with shredded paper towels.</p>
